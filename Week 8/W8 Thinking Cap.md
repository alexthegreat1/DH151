# W8 Thinking Cap

Listening to Albert's lecture and reading the Design Justice paper have really opened my eyes to
just how much more thought needs to go into the things we design because of its sweeping effects on
people's lives and experiences. They also made me realize how poorly most institutions are
addressing these concerns now. The idea of design justice as a whole is also much larger than I
would've thought. There need to be far-reaching, systemic changes to bring about many of the goals
listed in the article, such as increasing the diversity in tech. I loved the concrete examples that
were mentioned throughout the article because it helps tie the bigger ideas to the real world. This
includes the examples given to explain how design relates to domination and resistance at the three
levels: personal, community, and institutional.

I will definitely be trying my best to apply the ideas of design justice to any projects I work on
in the future. This would include really thinking about how I can make my work be as inclusive as
possible, and hopefully trying to get ideas from people who are usually more underrepresented and
who don't have the same background I do. I would also think about how the things I incorporate into
a project would affect people, taking from the ideas mentioned in Albert's lecture and the paper we
read. I would love to look at resources like "rubrics", guides, checklists, and best practices as
mentioned in the conclusion of Design Justice to really help me make sure I'm doing everything that
I can.
