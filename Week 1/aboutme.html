				Hi! My name is <strong>Alex Haddad</strong> and I'm a junior at
				UCLA studying Computer Science. I love how wide the scope of
				this class seems to be and can't wait to learn all about how to
				use web mapping in our projects, as well as analyzing and
				showing that data by leveraging API's. I'm also interested in
				the design aspect of this class.
