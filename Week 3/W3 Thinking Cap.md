Reading the linked article and watching the video on UX Design was very enlightening. The article's breakdown of the UX Pyramid was extremely helpful because it helped me understand what order UX design tends to go in and what is most important. Breaking it all down into 6 simpler parts makes it easier to digest and focus on each part at a time. I also loved the explained characteristics for each division of the pyramid in practical terms. I will definitely be applying these characteristics and questions to our project for this class and any projects I work on in the future.

As for the video, it really helped me understand how integrated UX Design is in the creation and manufacturing of the product. There are many more steps to it than I originally thought, such as research, drawing, wireframes, prototyping, etc. It seems like a very involved process and the end product of what UX Designers can do is very impressive.

## Questions

1. Is there a specific platform/goal/idea you've wanted to do/execute that you haven't had the chance to yet?
2. What platform (mobile, desktop websites, AR, etc.) do you most enjoy doing UX design for? Why?
